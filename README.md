# DSKC SIP 2023 - REPORT

## Cosmology: Data Simulation and Parameter Estimation

This repo contains all the collaborative work done by Ashok Kumar, Priyanshu Mahato, Kanika Kakran and Anisha Khatri as part of the DSKC Summer Internship Program 2023, organised by Miranda House, University.
We first attended lectures on Monte Carlo Simulations, Monte Carlo Integration, $\chi^2$ Analysis, Curve Fitting, Markov Chain Processes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods, etc. 
Currently, we are working on reproducing the results of a paper titled: "A test of linearity of the ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter in galaxy clusters".
